      <description>Just completed the renowned Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course (on Coursera) these couple of days. Since many people are curious about this course, I will do a quick write up on how I think about this course and what I actually learned.
About the Instructor Andrew Ng is the co-founder of Google Brain and Coursera, and an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He was also a former vice president and chief scientist at Baidu working on large scale artificial intelligence projects.</description>

      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing articles for almost half a year because I got back to school this spring. It&amp;rsquo;s really diffult to handle both the course works and side projects (such as maintaining a blog) at the same time, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to worry that I&amp;rsquo;ll have even less time writing after I graduate. The &amp;ldquo;harsh&amp;rdquo; reality and &amp;ldquo;tough&amp;rdquo; life often change our hobbies into more &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; ones unlike writing or other creative activities.</description>

      <description>My second game project Knights Rubbish has released!

Originally I was just doing some experiments with Godot Engine and trying to implement the barebones of a platformer, but then the project grew larger and larger as I combined it with other mechanics I was testing. After a year and couple of months, Knights Rubbish was born!
Real Photos as Game Graphics One of the coolest features in Knights Rubbish is that most of its graphics are made with processed photos.</description>

      <description>I just self-published my very first graphic novel Inter-dimensional Time recently, using Amazon&amp;rsquo;s KDP (Kindle Direct Publish) platform. In this article, I am going to share my experience with Amazon KDP, and briefly go through the process of self-publishing.
Introduction Amazon KDP is arguably the cheapest and most convenient self-publishing service out there. It requires no service fee and lets you publish your book in both eBook and paperback formats.</description>

      <description>I made an iOS Tuner &amp;amp; Metronome App last couple of months due to boredom. Suffering from boredom again this month, I decided to write an article on how I implement it.

In this article, I will show:
 How to sample audio from the microphone using AudioKit. How to calculate the notes from raw frequencies (of the sampled audio).  
I will not delve into how I implement the views since the code is quite bulky and tedious.</description>

      <description>I.Introduction: The Coin Tossing Problem Whenever you have difficulty deciding something, for example, whether to attend the lectures of a course or not, the most common thing to do in this scenario is to toss a coin and see whether the heads or tails of the coin is facing up when they land. Assume that the coin you toss is uniform, meaning that the chance of the heads to land facing up is equal to the chance of the tails to land facing up.</description>

      <description>Hello world, again!

Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving my blog around different platforms quite a bit this year. Within only 8 months I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger to a self hosted Ghost blog on an AWS server, and now, I moved all my articles on my AWS server to this new blog, using Hugo static page generator, hosted on GitHub.

The reason why I switched to Hugo on GitHub is quite simple.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I wrote an article about some camera moving schemes used in Metal Slug 3. In this article, I will show you how to actually implement such a camera.

I will be using the open source Godot Engine with GDScript since I believe any programmer with could understand GDScript quite easily, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.

First, let&amp;rsquo;s define some variables we&amp;rsquo;ll use later.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work on my first 2D side scrolling platformer recently. However, before diving into designing my own game, I did some quick research on various topics about 2D platformers. One of them is camera controlling (aka. scene scrolling).

I find some interesting camera controlling technique used in the Metal Slug series, so I would like to share my observations and analysis of how and when to apply those camera controlling schemes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already posted an article about Google Summer of Code 2017. However, the post is mainly about the project itself. For this article, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my experience and thoughts for the whole GSoC period.
Google Summer of Code 2017 was an extremely exciting and rewarding experience for me. I was very lucky to be accepted by Systers (Anita Borg Institute) for working on the PowerUp-iOS project.

Before heading straight into the actual GSoC period, I would like to write briefly about why and how I applied for GSoC.</description>

      <description>(This is an overview and conclusion for my summer internship (Google Summer of Code 2017) in Systers on the PowerUp-iOS project. The original article is posted on systers&amp;rsquo; Blogger. Here is the Link.)
Overview PowerUp is an educational mobile game app aiming at providing adolescent girls with reproductive health knowledge, empowering them with better self esteem, and teaching them conflict resolution skills in social life.

It is a choose-your-own-adventure game which the players have to navigate an avatar to engage in conversations of different scenarios.</description>

      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s Sprite Kit is a really well-designed and convenient framework for iOS game development. In this article, I will briefly introduce Sprite Kit Action (SKAction in short), which is the bread and butter for animating nodes in Sprite Kit.
The Basics In Sprite Kit, every node can run an SKAction by calling the run(_:) function. run(_:) takes an SKAction as its parameter, and will perform the action immediately after the call.</description>

      <description>After finishing 2 of my projects in Unity, I was planning to try out something different and hopefully, more suitable for me to use. I did a quick research on some modern cross platform game engines: Godot, Cocos2d-x, Atomic, Love2D, Phaser, and of course, Unreal. I finally decided to look more into Godot Engine. In this article, I will write briefly about the features, the special node-scene system, as well as the pros and cons of Godot Engine.</description>

      <description>Testing your code is a vital process in app development, since it could reveal bugs and mistakes before the users actually use it. However, testing your app whenever you make a commit can be tedious and time-consuming. This is where Continuous Integration (CI) comes to rescue.
Continuous Integration Continuous Integration is the process of building and testing your app automatically, saving precious time for the developers. In this article, I will demonstrate how to integrate Travis CI to your XCode projects (to be specific, iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS projects) on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Writing code for database querying or updating can be tedious, error-prone, and hard to manage. Therefore, abstracting the database operations into a globally accessible model class may be a nice solution. In this article, I will show you how to write a singleton class which wraps the database operations. I will use FMDB (SQLite) with Swift 3 to demonstrate, but it is just about the same for every languages and frameworks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) someday. Fortunately, this year, I got selected by Systers, an Anita Borg Institute community for a mobile game project &amp;ndash; PowerUp. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about how I chose which project to contribute, how I wrote my proposal, and what is the PowerUp project about.
Selecting Organizations When selecting which organizations to contribute, I focus mostly on what am I capable of doing, what interests me the most, and which projects would enhance my portfolio for my dream career.</description>

      <description>中文版 (Chinese Version)

Finally finished reading the famous &amp;ldquo;The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses&amp;rdquo; by Jesse Schell. Jesse Schell is a professor at CMU ETC (which happens to be my dream graduate school :D) and an experienced game designer. Throughout the book, he often explains some abstract concepts by his actual experience in game designing (especially from the game Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold and Toontown Online which he designed) and performance art (he was a juggler during his teenage years).</description>

      <description>Using particle systems is a wonderful way to improve the juiciness as well as the aesthetics of your game.

When making my rhythm game Boots-Cuts, I used the particle system in Unity to display a little firework effect whenever a music note is hit on-beat.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to make such an effect.
Texture and Material First, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to import the the graphics which we would like the particle systems to emit (aka.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve published my first game kQq on iOS App Store and Google Play in February. Though the sales were far from success, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot (or rather I like to use this excuse as self-consolation&amp;hellip;). Thinking that this game would also work on standalone platforms and that I would gain some precious experiences by porting the game to standalone platforms, I started working on the redesign of the project and published a Steam Greenlight page for it.</description>

      <description>Marketing is an annoying and boring task&amp;hellip;at least for most of the indie game developers. However, you have to admit, marketing helps. It raises awareness among the potential audiences and possibly boosts the sales of your game.

The problem is, indies have limited budget, so it is impossible to practice the marketing skills which AAA companies use.

As I went through the process of developing and publishing my first mobile game &amp;ndash; kQq, I learned some basic marketing skills by reading tons of marketing articles as well as trying everything possible.</description>

      <description>Modern mobile devices usually have a rectangular screen which one side is wider than the other. This results in a crucial design problem: which screen orientation is the best for mobile games?

This seems to be a rather simple and unimportant issue. However, whether the game is in portrait or in landscape could significantly influence the experience of the players.

Overall, to determine whether a portrait or landscape screen suits your game better, you should ask yourself these questions:</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started my beatbox rhythm game project Boots-Cut using Unity. When prototyping the basic game mechanics, I found that it is quite tricky to sync the music notes with the music correctly. However, there are very little articles on the web concerning this subject. So, I will try to point out some important tips when developing a rhythm game (especially in Unity) in this article.

Among all, I found the following three points with most importance:</description>

Since integrating Unity In-App Purchase and Google Admob are rather straightforward, I would be writing mostly about (the more troublesome parts, which are)
